Usage Instructions
Prerequisites:
Ensure a LaTeX distribution (e.g., TeX Live, MikTeX, or MacTeX) is installed. The template depends on packages such as amsmath, graphicx, natbib, geometry, among others.

Compilation:
Use your preferred LaTeX editor or command-line tool. A typical compilation sequence is as follows:

css
Copy
pdflatex main.tex
bibtex main
pdflatex main.tex

Customization:
Replace placeholders (e.g., [Thesis Title], [Author Name], [Institution Name]) with your actual information. Modify class options and geometry settings as required to adhere to your institution's guidelines.

Modular Structure:
The template is organized by chapters. Uncomment or adjust the \input{...} commands to include your own chapter files, and create additional files if necessary.
